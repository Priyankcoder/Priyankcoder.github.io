<!-- It is a fully secured server-side user authentication system that supports 4 different authentication modes and
capable of handling errors and exceptions. It is developed using express.js from scratch. It supports local sign-in, sign-out, Google and Github Oauth. It verify registered users through verification email using
nodemailer. -->

<!-- Access to quality healthcare and doctors has always been a concern. According to WHO, Unawareness and carelessness among people regarding their health, Low ratio of doctor to patient, and cost of consultancy prevent detection of deadly diseases such as Cancer, Heart Diseases, Lung Diseases, Pneumonia, and Malaria etc. at early stage leading to death of victim in 90% of the cases. -->

I and My team together build this web application that provides five trained ML models for diagnostics that are implemented after quality research papers.
These five different models can predict about Heart Disease, Liver Disease, Lung Disease, Pneumonia, and Malaria with upto 90% accuracy if feeded with the valid lab reports. 
User just need to upload the lab report on web application under the right model. After that, OCR will extract the data then model will predict if user is healthy or not and that whole process takes atmost one minute.
Based on the model result, the user can consult with the doctor and can effectively stop deadly disease at a very early stage. This web application is fast, reliable, accurate, and easy to use.
